# Plugin-Auditor

The Plugin-Auditor is a WordPress plugin that records who and when installed other plugins and also asks the user to add a short comment to explain why they installed it.

It is important to clean out unused plugins and keep your plugins up to date, but this can be difficult if you have forgotten why you installed them in the first place.  This is particularly true for sites with multiple admin users, and for agencies that manage their clients sites.

You don't want to delete an old plugin without being 100% sure why it was installed and therefore know if it is still needed. 

The Plugin Auditor tells you why each plugin was installed and also keeps a record of who installed it so that you know who to ask if you have any questions when performing maintenance on the site.
